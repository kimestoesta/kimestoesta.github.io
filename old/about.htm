        About
            <h2>Hello! My name is Kim Estoesta and I am a junior in the Graphic Design program at the University of Florida. I am a designer, illustrator, and videographer that loves to combine my love for art and technology. I balance my passion to create and design with a love for technology, gaming, and coding to produce a variety of different work. I currently work at the Arts and Crafts Center at the University of Florida and at Staterspace, a Gainesville start-up incubator, as the creative director. <br><br>
            Beyond designing you can find me planning events for the Filipino Student Association at the University of Florida. In FSA I've had the chance to learn to dance, play flag football, learn about my culture, and have a home away from home. In my spare time I enjoy eating, riding my long board, jamming with friends, binge watching Netflix, and making frequent visits to Disney World.<br><br>
            Want to hear more fun facts about me? Think I'm really cool? Don't hesitate to contact me at <u>kimestoesta@gmail.com</u>!</h2>
