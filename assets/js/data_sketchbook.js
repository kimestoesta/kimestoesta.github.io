    description: "I wanted to make a special takeaway item to leave or send people to remind them of me and my work. I wanted it to show a side of me that was a little harder to express on a portfolio or website. I really like paper art and physically making work so I decided to desgn a pop up card. I've never done this type of paper art work so it was a big learning curving trying to figure out how to make this card. First I started with some sketches of what I wanted it to look like then did some problem solving using cut outs and troubleshooting.$$$ At this point I started to create the general boxes I needed to fold and cut on illustrator. The computer screen faintly shows the file I was working on in illustrator.$ Here I figured out the right pop up mechanism and I could finally put in the dtails of the images I wanted to have popout. $ Did some scaling and now it's all set and ready to send! $"

    description: "Inspired by the broadway musical 'Finding Neverland' I created a paper pop-up to reflect on the idea of never growing up. I watched this amazing musical over the summer in NYC. To some it may seem immature to never grow up but I think this musical beautifully describes what staying young at heart really means. Life has so many struggles, it is easy to become disheartened but when you look at the world through the eyes of a child I find there is still magic and beauty left to believe in. $$$$$"
